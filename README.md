# FlameGuard - Forest Fire Prediction
Introduction:
**FlameGuard** is a Forest Fire Prediction project aimed at creating a highly accurate and efficient machine learning model that predicts the probability of forest fires based on key environmental factors. The system's primary goal is to offer a user-friendly and reliable tool for mitigating the risks associated with forest fires. Users input data such as oxygen levels, temperature, and humidity, and the model generates a prediction on a scale from 0 to 1. If a significant risk of fire is detected, the system automatically alerts the relevant authorities by sending an email, ensuring timely intervention.
